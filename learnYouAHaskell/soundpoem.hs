keyboard’s go clack
Clickity clickity clack
It’s the most annoying sound in the world
And the most powerful sound in the world
click click clack

The sound of generation
The sound of pure and infinite creation
The keyboard creates the poem
click click click
It creates itself
It’s the key to the power

The power of billions - 
billions and billions - 
of operations every second

processors are silent. fans go whir.
click click clack whir
It gets loud when you push it
The computer, like a child
It whines and it yells
whirrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

but it’ll do whatever you want
It’s a bit stupid sometimes
You have to remind it
to check if its on fire
click whir click clack

and it COMPLAINS
Oh man it complains
but with the clack
of a keyboard
you can do anything.
whirrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

What’s the length of the collatz chain of 15,000 factorial? No problem.
Sort this list of a 100,000,000 integers. No problem.
That’s the power.
click click clack whir
